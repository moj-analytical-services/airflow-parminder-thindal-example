## How to use

Click the green "Use this template" button when creating your airflow repo. **Please ensure `moj-analytical-services` is selected as the owner of the repo while doing so, and NOT your own github account, otherwise the upload action will fail.**

Please refer to the AP user guidance on [Airflow](https://user-guidance.services.alpha.mojanalytics.xyz/tools/airflow/instructions/image-pipeline) for instructions on how to modify and use your new repo.
